# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

AI_web is a web application project with a planned architecture separating backend and frontend concerns. The repository is currently in its initial setup phase.

## Repository Structure

```
AI_web/
├── backend/     # Backend application code (empty - awaiting implementation)
├── frontend/    # Frontend application code (empty - awaiting implementation)
└── src/         # Source code (empty - awaiting implementation)
```

## Development Environment

- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA (project configuration present in `.idea/` and `AI_web.iml`)
- **Module Type**: Java module with source folder configured at `src/`
- **Version Control**: Git repository initialized

## Notes for Development

- The project structure suggests a separation between backend and frontend components, but the specific technology stack has not yet been established
- The `.gitignore` is configured for Java/IntelliJ IDEA projects with support for Eclipse, NetBeans, VS Code, and macOS
- Source files should be placed in the `src/` directory according to the IntelliJ module configuration
- Backend and frontend directories are currently empty and awaiting architectural decisions on frameworks and languages to use
